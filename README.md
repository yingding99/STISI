"rankAFT.R": rank-based estimation method for semiparameter AFT models. 
"JointImputeLM.R": STISI for a continuous outcome Y, with substantive model being the linear model with normal errors.
"JointImputeGLM_logis.R": STISI for a binary outcome Y, with substantive model being the logistic model.
"JointImputeTTE_Cox.R": STISI for a time-to-event outcome (Y, Delta.Y), with substantive model being the Cox proportional hazards model.
